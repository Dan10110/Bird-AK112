There are 3 parts for the frame- head, back, and tail. The nead and back should be printed twice- one normal and the other mirrored. Use LW PLA to print them.
The wing pattern part is used as template to cut the wing film. The wing frame part should be printed flipped. The grooves are on the bottom now. Put the CR on the grooves to hold them in place while you glue them.
