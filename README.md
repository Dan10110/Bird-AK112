# Bird-AK112
This is an information folder for the bird AK112 I made based on video from Kazuhiko Kakuta's Youtub.

Mr. Kakuta is very skillful in cutting carbon fiber sheet to make the frame. He is also a very good artist that can decorate the bird. I am neither and so I use Fusion360 to make a template for the wing and the wing structure. In this way, I can make the wings as symmetric as possible.
I also designed and 3D printed the head, back, and tail structures. To save weight, I used LW PLA. I think it added about 3g extra but saved me a lot of work.

The bird weights about 30g with a 150mah battery.
