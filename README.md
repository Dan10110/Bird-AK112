# Bird-AK112
This is an information folder for the bird AK112 I made based on video from Kazuhiko Kakuta's Youtub.

  Mr. Kakuta is very skillful in cutting carbon fiber sheet to make the frame. He is also a very good artist that can decorate the bird. I can do neither and so I use Fusion360 to make a template for the wing and the wing structure. In this way, I can make the wings as symmetric as possible.
I also designed and 3D printed the head, back, and tail structures. To save weight, I used LW PLA. I think it added about 3g extra but saved me a lot of work.
  
  The bird weights about 30g with a 150mah battery. It is pretty crash proof. I only had minor repairs after more than 30 flights in my backyard.

  # A note about flying the bird:
  I have tried using delaytime from 120ms to 70ms. The best flying one is 90ms. If you found controlling the bird frustrating, here is the suggestion. I found that full flapping amptitude is not only energy inefficient, it doesn't fly well either. If you are set to full amplitude at launch, the bird is very difficult to control. When I dial back to about mid-stick, the bird is much more controllable. When I launch the bird, I don't flap the wings yet. I do that after the launch otherwise there is no much drag. Also, do the launch horizontally.
    
I found elevator control is very sensitive and aileron not sensitive. I guess it depends somewhat on the CG. My battery is all the way at the back and the bird glides very well. So, I use exponetial function in my transmitter to counter the sensitivity issue.
